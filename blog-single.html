              Why does working in a startup increase your
              responsibilities?</p>
             <blockquote><p>The goal of the owner for a new startup is to take their startup to a
              different level. For this, he needs responsible and enthusiastic people.
              Working in a startup gives you an environment where you can be
              responsible for a lot of work. There are many tasks in a new startup
              that make you more responsible for your work. Here you can find two
              or more jobs. Which takes your responsibility to a higher level. On
              the contrary, you have to do the same job for years. In a startup, you
              also find diversity at work. And one thing we can clearly say from this
              is that by working with a startup you have to be strongly involved in
              the work yourself. On the other hand, if you do one job at a time
              sitting in the same place, the connection to work can be reduced.
              Prons of Working in a Startup:
              Diversity in work
              You can get more than one job which increases your
              responsibility and skills.
              Increased work ethic
              More responsibility improves the outcome of the work.</p></blockquote>

             <li><strong> Cons of Working in a Job:</strong></li>
              
              One’s work may have to be repeated
              Have the responsibility of one job/work so that the attachment
              to work decreases.
              No diversity in work.
              | Develop Innovative Ideas
              
             <li><strong>Find something new in your thoughts?</strong></li>
              <p>Creativity and diversity in their product are essential to give a startup
              a distinct success. It is not possible to attract a customer without it so
              it requires innovation in ideas. It is necessary for students or
              employees to diversify their ideas in a startup which will help them to
              take their startup forward. So you will always be inspired to think of a
              new variety. When in any job you have to do the work that is given to you and you can not bring any creativity in it. Thinking about this, we
              can naturally say that it is an excellent platform for displaying skills.</p>

              Be bound by fewer ideas with the same work
              Overview of Vision</p>
              
              <p>You work in a startup so you know which direction to take your work.
              Planning from start to finish you know what to do. You have a whole
              map ready in which direction to go. While In a Job the boss will give
              you one task in the job and tell what you have to do but you will never
              know what the target is and how and what the future process for this
              product is like. But In Startup, You have a goal and you have an idea
              of what you want to do. In short, you have an overview of the whole</p>
              
              plan, what you should and should not do. Everything has to be taken
              care of.
